# Work Tracker

Work Tracker is (as suggested by the name) a program which enables you to track the work hours of your different projects.
You can record the hours you spend live, or manually add the work you did. When you have finished with a certain project, you can export to Excel where you can process the data as you wish.

<h3>Notes</h3>
- This software automatically updates itself (it scans for new releases on GitHub), so internet access is recommended on start-up of software.
- <strong>The software requires the Roboto Mono font to be installed for it to look as intended.</strong>
